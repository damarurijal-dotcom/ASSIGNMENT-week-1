   <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><b>I am an active and curious individual who enjoys continuous learning and personal growth.
         In my free time, I like exploring technology, improving my computer skills, 
         and staying updated with new digital trends. I also enjoy reading books that broaden my knowledge,
          travelling to experience different cultures, and participating in sports to stay physically fit. 
          Additionally, I value teamwork and often take part in group activities, volunteering,
           and community events to build strong communication and leadership skills.</b></p>
